# Shallow-water Topology: Arranging Waves on the Rotating Sphere

This repository includes numerical scripts (Mathematica and Python 3) used in the article "Topology of shallow-water waves on the rotating sphere", Perez et al (to be published).

The Jupyter notebook SLSW_dedalus3.ipynb computes the spectrum on the sphere using a curvilinear basis of the Python library Dedalus 3.  
The Jupyter notebook SLSW_dedalus2.ipynb computes the spectrum on the sphere using the Chebyshev basis of the Python library Dedalus 2.  
The Mathematica notebook SLSW_berry_curvature.nb computes the Berry curvature and the Chern numbers of the symbol.
