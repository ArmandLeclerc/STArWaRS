Shallow-water Topology: Arranging Waves on the Rotating Sphere


This repository includes numerical scripts (Mathematica and Python 3) used in the article "Topology of shallow-water waves on the rotating sphere", Perez et al (to be published).

The Jupyter notebook xxx.nypb computes the spectrum on the sphere using curvilinear bases of the Python library Dedalus 3.  
The Jupyter notebook xxx.nypb computes the spectrum on the sphere using Chebyshev bases of the Python library Dedalus 2.  
The Mathematica notebook xxx.nb computes the Berry curvature and the Chern numbers of the symbol.
